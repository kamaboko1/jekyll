The planet was claimed, in September 2010,[21] to have been detected by astronomers in the Lick–Carnegie Exoplanet Survey, led by principal investigator Steven Vogt,[21] professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz,[21] and co-investigator R. Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The discovery was made using radial velocity measurements,[21] combining 122 observations obtained over 11[21] years from the HIRES instrument of the W. M. Keck Observatory[21] with 119 measurements obtained over 4.3 years from the HARPS[21] instrument of the ESO 3.6 m Telescope[21] at La Silla Observatory.[18] In addition, brightness measurements of the star were confirmed with a robotic telescope[21] from Tennessee State University.[1]
