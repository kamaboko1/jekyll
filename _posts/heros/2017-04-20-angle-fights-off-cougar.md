Eleven-year-old Austin Forman was collecting firewood in his backyard when he noticed his dog, Angel, sticking unusually close to his side. Soon, Austin realized why â€” when he was attacked by an unseen cougar.

Angel fearlessly leapt at the cougar to protect his owner. While the dog and giant cat were fighting, Austin ran into the house and told his mother, "There's a cougar eating Angel." She immediately called 911, but by the time the authorities arrived, Angel had suffered deep wounds and his survival seemed uncertain. However, Angel stunned everyone by getting up despite his injuries in order to make sure Austin was okay. Thankfully, Angel was too.
