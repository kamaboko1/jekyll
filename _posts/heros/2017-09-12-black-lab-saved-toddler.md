Patricia Drauch was in her garden when suddenly she realized her 14-month-old son, Stanley, had disappeared. She searched everywhere and finally found him: He was face up in the pool with his eyes rolled back and his lips blue. But luckily, Stanley wasn't alone in the pool. The family dog, Bear, was with him and was standing perfectly still underneath the boy in order to keep the boy's head above water. Authorities later confirmed that Stanley had almost drowned and likely owes Bear his life.
