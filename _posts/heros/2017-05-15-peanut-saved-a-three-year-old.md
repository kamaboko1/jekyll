On the morning of St. Patrick's Day, Peanut's owner said that her rescue dog started acting a bit crazy. After running around and barking all over the house, the owner finally let Peanut outside. The dog forcefully led her owner through the field behind their house to a three-year-old girl, who was naked and shivering in a ditch.

Peanut's owner wrapped the young girl in a sweatshirt and called the authorities. Peanut was sadly no stranger to suffering. When she was rescued, she was in bad shape: She had broken ribs, two broken legs, and a belly full of carpet. Perhaps that's what made her so attuned to the pain of the little girl.
