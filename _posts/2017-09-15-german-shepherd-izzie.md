Izzie is a 21 month old female. Izzie is a very intelligent and extremely athletic dog. 

She spends her days sitting in this chair 
keeping an eye over the farm, cattle, chickens, and even the cats. At night she keeps the coyotes from getting close to the house. 

She also is an excellent hunting dog. Several times I have seen her jump up and catch pheasants out of the air. No need for a gun when hunting with this dog.
